# The Streets

My favorite creation to date. A full-fledged text adventure with several bells and whistles, much more complex than my Prison Text Adventure (with the caveat of being much more complicated and requiring much more time). I also believe it is more entertaining as it is 99% original (shout out to 'Learning Python the Hard Way' for teaching me to make a game engine).

It is not finished by any means (lots of descriptions to be desired) but it is fully functional. However, there may be several bugs. I think I squashed most of them, but that's from a developer's point of view (which I think is super skewed).

Anyway, this project is my baby and I'm rather proud of it. I've been coding for 3 1/2 months by this point and I'm amazed at what I know now compared to when I started. Makes me excited for a lifetime of learning in this field!

Thanks for reading (:
